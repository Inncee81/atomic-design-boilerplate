# Grumble
### 'My' "Framework"

## The problem

Blah fucking blach

---

## The current solutions

---

### Bootstrap (a.k.a 'Boo'-strap)

- Large community (does it honestly matter?)
- Used by Twitter, one of the worlds most profitable Social Networks
- BUT, it outputs f**king horrible markup


---

## The 'actual' solution

- A combination of the above, with a 'Bootstrap'-esque SASS authoring framework, but semantic front-end.
- Using Atomic Design, we can define atoms, and build modules
